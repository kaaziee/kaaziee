# Hey, I'm Kaazie! 

I'm an pentester and programmer. 

I make bots and tools for hackers and pentesters.

I am currently still in school and I have a part time job. 

When I have free time I play games and go out with friends. 

In the future I would like to help people with projects in cybersecurity but i'm also interested in projects not related to cybersecurity.
